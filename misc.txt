To know the name of the python methods for the API
http://library.gnome.org/devel/rhythmbox/unstable,
go to the source: rhythmbox/bindings/python and grep for the c method name, e.g.

$ grep "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source" *
rb.defs:  (c-name "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source")

So we can see in rb.defs:

(define-method get_playing_source
  (of-object "RBShellPlayer")
  (c-name "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source")
  (return-type "RBSource*")
)

Which gives us the information that the python name is get_playing_source.


Another good thing is to know that you can use the interactive python console in rhytmbox and use class.__dict__ to get all method, e.g.:

print rb.Shell.__dict__
shell = rb.Shell()
shell.__class__.__dict__
player = shell.get_player()

// list all entries in the current source

>>> for row in shell.props.selected_source.props.query_model:
... 	entry = row[0]
... 	print shell.props.db.entry_get(entry, rhythmdb.PROP_TITLE)

How do I get a list of the user's playlists?

Playlists are stored in the source list model, the gtk.TreeModel in the left hand pane. Get a reference to the source list model with (shell.props.sourcelist.props.model. The "Playlists" header item is therefore playlist_mode_header = [x for x in list(shell.props.sourcelist.props.model) if list(x)[2] == "Playlists"][0], and you can get a list of playlist TreeModelRows with playlist_model_header.iterchildren(), so


How do I get the list of songs in a source?

A source's songs are stored in source.props.base_query_model, a gtk.TreeModel. Each item in that model is a gtk.TreeModelRow with two columns, a RhythmDBEntry and a path. So, to print all songs in a source:


for treerow in source.props.base_query_model:
  entry, path = list(treerow)
  print entry

23:57 < moch> since you want to select artists for playback, the way to do this is probably to find the artist property view for the library source, get the 
              model from that, then iterate through it to get the artist names
23:57 < moch> to select an artist, you call rb_property_view_set_selection on that property view, passing in a list containing the artist names you want to 
              select
