To know the name of the python methods for the API
http://library.gnome.org/devel/rhythmbox/unstable,
go to the source: rhythmbox/bindings/python and grep for the c method name, e.g.

$ grep "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source" *
rb.defs:  (c-name "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source")

So we can see in rb.defs:

(define-method get_playing_source
  (of-object "RBShellPlayer")
  (c-name "rb_shell_player_get_playing_source")
  (return-type "RBSource*")
)

Which gives us the information that the python name is get_playing_source.

How do I get a list of the user's playlists?

Playlists are stored in the source list model, the gtk.TreeModel in the left hand pane. Get a reference to the source list model with (shell.props.sourcelist.props.model. The "Playlists" header item is therefore playlist_mode_header = [x for x in list(shell.props.sourcelist.props.model) if list(x)[2] == "Playlists"][0], and you can get a list of playlist TreeModelRows with playlist_model_header.iterchildren(), so


How do I get the list of songs in a source?

A source's songs are stored in source.props.base_query_model, a gtk.TreeModel. Each item in that model is a gtk.TreeModelRow with two columns, a RhythmDBEntry and a path. So, to print all songs in a source:


for treerow in source.props.base_query_model:
  entry, path = list(treerow)
  print entry
