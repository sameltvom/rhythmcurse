Installation

  $ mkdir -p ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins
  $ cd ~/.gnome2/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins
  $ git clone git://github.com/sameltvom/rhythmcurse.git

Next time you open rhythmbox go to menu edit → Plugins → rhytmcurse and check it.
After that you can do

  $ telnet rhythmboxhost 5000

where rhythmboxhost is the host where rhythmbox is playing.

Bugs
For now you have to do “no artist” before you can do “set artist ”.
